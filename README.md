# ember-tic-tac-toe
Continuing my series of 'creating mediocre web applications', here's a very poorly done Tic Tac Toe emulation. 
* **User Story:** I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
* **User Story:** My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
* **User Story:** I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Demo
